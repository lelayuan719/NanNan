NanNan: Grandma? 
Grandma: The thunder rumbles, the rain pours. Little child, hurry back home.
NanNan: Where is my home? 
Grandma: Your home is right there, under the big mountain, where your father and mother are. 
NanNan: Are you not coming with me? 
Grandma: The mountain road is dangerous and slippery. Little child, hurry back home.
