Xiaoying: NanNan, thank you for bringing this to me... I finally remember why my spirit has been trapped for so long.
Mr. Li: I can’t believe you hid this from me all these years, Principal.
Principal: Woah! Where did you come from!? NanNan, I thought you came here alone.
Principal: You little brat, you’re trying to get me in trouble, aren’t you? Girls these days are smarter than I thought...
Xiaoying: You... you’re the one that ruined my life! I hate you so much!!!
