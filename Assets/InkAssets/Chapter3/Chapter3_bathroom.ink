Xiaoying: NanNan, is that you?
NanNan: Xiaoying, why are you here?
Xiaoying: My stomach feels weird.. NanNan, did something happen?
NanNan: My backpack was thrown to the second floor, I have to go find it.
Xiaoying: Second floor? ...That’s not a good place. Could you not go? I think you’ve heard of the story of the red girl.
NanNan: I know, I’m scared too. But if I return home without my bag, my parents will beat me.
Xiaoying: ...NanNan, my good friend, can you help me with something? The headmaster took my stickers away, can you help me get them back? They’re behind his desk...
NanNan: Um, ok... I’ll try my best...
