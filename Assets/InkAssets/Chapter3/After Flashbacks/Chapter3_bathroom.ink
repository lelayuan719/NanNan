Xiaoying: NanNan, is that you?
NanNan: Xiaoying, why are you here?
Xiaoying: Oh, stomach bug. Did something happen to you, NanNan?
NanNan: Someone tossed my backpack onto the second floor, I have to go find it.
Xiaoying: Second floor? That’s not a good place, don’t go there. The red girl’s story isn’t just a myth.
NanNan: I know, I’m scared too. But if I go home without my bag, my parents will kill me.
Xiaoying: Then... NanNan, my good friend, can you help me with something? The headmaster took my necklace from me, can you help me get it back? It should be in his desk drawer...
NanNan: Um, sure... I’ll try my best...
