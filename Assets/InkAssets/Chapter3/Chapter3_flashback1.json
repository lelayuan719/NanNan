You get good test grades... but what are they even good for?","\n","^Mr. Li: Don’t do so well next time. Get a bad test grade and give up your spot to the boys in your class. How will you take responsibility if they don’t get into middle school because of you?","\n","^NanNan: But...","\n","^Mr. Li: Here, think about it. One of the boys in your class will probably become your husband in the future. You’ll rely on him for the rest of your life. Let them get into middle school, marry one of them, and give him two healthy little sons. Simple, easy, and your life is fulfilled.","\n","^Mr. Li: Little girls shouldn’t study in the first place. It’s best to stay at home. Besides, what if something happens to your fragile body while you’re running around outside? Will your parents be able to take care of you? Nannan, listen to your teacher. All this time you use to study could be better used to help with chores at home. Find a good husband when you’re older, and your parents will never have to worry about you.","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
