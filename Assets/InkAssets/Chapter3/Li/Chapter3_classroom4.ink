Mr. Li: What’s going on here? Why haven’t you finished cleaning up this mess? #liAppear
NanNan: Um...
Mr. Li: Ugh. Just take the key and go get your bag, I’ll take care of it. I don’t get paid enough for this... #liMove
Mr. Li: Hold on- what’s that in your hand?
Nannan: Um... I found it here...
Mr. Li: Why do you have this necklace!?
Nannan: It’s not mine! It’s the Principal’s, I swear!
Mr. Li: What the... that creep! Whatever, give that to me! #giveInstrument
