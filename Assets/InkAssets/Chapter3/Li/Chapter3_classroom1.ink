Mr. Li: Agh.. who is it?
NanNan: Sir, it’s me.
NanNan: Mr. Li, I... I left something on the second floor, can you lend me the key to open the metal door?
Mr. Li: You- sigh. How many times did I say not to go to the second floor? It’s not safe up there.
Mr. Li: I already lent the key to the security guard, you have such bad timing. Just wait until tomorrow, I’ll get it for you in the morning.
NanNan: No, sir, I really need to get it now. I’m sorry…
Mr. Li: Sigh. Look, I have a lot to do, so help me out: go to the classroom and help me find my math textbook.
