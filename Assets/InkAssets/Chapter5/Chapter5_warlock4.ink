Warlock: My dear Nannan... Actually, I still need one more thing.
Nannan: What, what do you need?
Warlock: A young girl's... virginity!
Nannan: Ahh! Don't come over here! You, you're... I’m going to tell my parents!
Warlock: They agreed to this ages ago! Sacrificing you, a money sink, to save your little brother was the easiest decision they ever made!
Warlock: Here, come here! Don’t make me get violent!
