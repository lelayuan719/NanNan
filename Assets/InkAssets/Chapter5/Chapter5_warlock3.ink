Warlock: Rice is the best thing to ward off evil! By making a circle around him, we're preventing the evil spirit in his body from running away.
Warlock: The feet are where the yin escapes the human body. Your brother wears these shoes every day, so the evil energy has polluted them and turned them into his second self. We have to let the Buddha inspect it.
Warlock: I'll use the rest of the rice later.
Warlock: 南无慈悲大菩萨，揭谛揭谛波罗揭谛，额，急急如律令，妖魔退散快退散...
Baby Brother: Waaaaaaaaaa!
Warlock: Cry, crying is good! Look, your brother can feel that someone is saving him, and he’s fighting the evil spirit right now...
Warlock: You can put him back in his room now.
