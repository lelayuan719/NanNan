Nannan: Warlock, my parents told me to help you prepare the ritual.
Warlock: Good Nannan... my dear Nannan!
Warlock: Then you must listen to everything I say, with the utmost obedience. Otherwise your brother will...!
The Warlock slices his hand across his neck and makes a fake choking sound.
Warlock: Go prepare these things! A broom, your little brotherâ€™s shoes, an ink brush and ink, and all the rice in your house!
