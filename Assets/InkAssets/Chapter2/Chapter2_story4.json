I don't know.","\n","^Grandma: But later, things from the outside world came to us, people saw cars, and people talking in small boxes... Fewer and fewer people actually remember these ancient traditions.","\n","^Grandma: Later, people became more and more disrespectful to the mountains and forests. They cut down the wood and sold it to people outside. Even the bailing fruit, which was only supplied to the Great Immortal, was picked and sold.","\n","^Grandma: A long time ago, the bailing fruit was really bailing fruit. No matter what you were sick with, you would feel better after eating bailing fruit. Now it is just an ordinary fruit.","\n","^Grandma: But the Great Immortal also has a temper... When people provoke it, it will retaliate... Twenty years ago, the second boy of the Li family from the next village cut down the thousand-year-old tree by the Great Immortal well. Later... later …","\n","^NanNan: What happened to him later?","\n","^Grandma: Then he went crazy! He made a bed out of the wood of that tree. When he slept on it, in the middle of the night, he always felt like he was being eaten by a big sticky mouth. He could never fall asleep and his wife was scared away…","\n","^Grandma: Later, he used the axe that chopped down the tree to kill his son and daughter, and then set himself and the children on fire in the house. That smell of burning flesh could be smelled from ten miles away...","\n","^NanNan: Ah! That’s very scary! This, this is what the Great Immortal did? Is it pretending to be so nice to me?","\n","^Grandma: Silly child, how can mortals understand what is good and bad to immortals...","\n","^Grandma: Anyways, later, in the burnt ruins of his house, people found the unscathed wooden bed, and a shiny snake slough. But the kids’ bodies could not be found... Everyone knows that the Great Immortal is taking revenge.","\n","^Grandma: Up to now, how many people in the village have done bad things to the Great Immortal; cutting down trees, digging up the ground... no one will go to sacrifice to the Great Immortal anymore, so they dare not let children go up the mountain.","\n","^Grandma: They teach you those nursery songs, all because of their guilt...","\n","^NanNan: Then why did my parents let me come to the mountain?","\n","^Grandma: Cough! Cough cough! Guilty!","\n","^Grandma: Your parents, your parents! Your parents are the most sorry for Daxian. They sinned and sinned and that Warlock, he will be punished by heaven! Cough, cough, cough...","\n","^Grandma: Oh, let's not mention it, NanNan, good girl, remember it, every time you go up the mountain to pick fruit, put a few on the edge of the Great Immortal's well and talk to it. And for the gifts it gives you, you must keep them safe, please keep them safe.","\n","^Grandma: Promise grandma, you must take them with you always, and keep them intact... Did you understand?","\n","^Nan Nan: Okay, okay grandma.","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
